After months of slaving away at my Macbook, i'm so glad to finally reveal my first open source theme to the world. Woohoo

This is <b>Minimal Jekyll Theme</b> and it looks so damn good if i do say so myself.
Lets take a look at what you can achieve starting with the most minimal of layouts.
- [A minimal post with a title]({{ '/title-only-post/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with a title and subtitle]({{ '/minimal-post-with-a-title-and-subtitle/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with post meta above title]({{ '/post-with-post-meta/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with post meta and an author bio]({{ '/post-with-author-bio/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with share icons.]({{ '/post-with-share-icons/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with categories and tags]({{ '/post-with-categories-and-tags/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [A post with comments turned off]({{ '/post-with-no-comments/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}
- [This post has been updated]({{ '/post-updated/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}

You can find out more info about customizing the Minimal Jekyll theme in the [theme documentation]({{ '/docs/' | relative_url }}){: .dim}, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/){: .dim}.
